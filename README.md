# hello-world
My First Repository!

I'm Justin, and I've been unknowingly doing website stuff for about 5 years, thanks to my old website.

  I've recently been through a career change, and I figured getting more learned in website development (and hopefully app development)
    will not only improve my website, but give me a new career path that my wife and kids can be proud of.
    
  I wish I could say something clever, like the "ReadMe" tutorial- you know, about eating tacos on the moon- but I can't.  I'm still working towards that!
  
  I want to learn; not just by getting my hands dirty, but I plan on going back to school for this (which I have!).  I'm always open for suggestions, advice, or whatever- and I     hope to one day be in a place to do the same for others here.
